# Logo Image Placement

Please place your infinity symbol logo image in this directory with the filename:

**`infinity-logo.png`**

The image should be:
- PNG format (or any web-compatible image format)
- High resolution for best quality
- Transparent background (recommended)
- The exact infinity symbol design you want to use

The logo will be automatically used throughout the application in:
- Login page
- Register page
- Landing page
- Dashboard
- All navigation bars
- And all other pages

If the image is not found, the system will fallback to a gradient SVG infinity symbol.
